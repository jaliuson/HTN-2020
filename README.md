# VERSA : Drinks for Everyone
## Hack the North 2020++

This year I had the pleasure of attending Hack the North 2020++ where my teammate and I built VERSA, an app that finds and suggests drinks for users. This repo documents what we achieved over the 36hours that we dedicated to developing the Android app. VERSA was built in Android studio (Java) and uses SQL to store the user reviews and prefrences to generate suggestions in the future.
